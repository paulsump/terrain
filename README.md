# Terrain

A procedurally generated 3d terrain renderer written in Flutter.

## Plan

More generalised classes than the one's written in Subdivide. For example, by storing vertex
normals, there won't be any assumptions made to calculate them later. I'm not planning on anything
fancy, just a simple mesh renderer.
